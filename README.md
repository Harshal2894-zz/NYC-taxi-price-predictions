# NYC-taxi-price-predictions
This is a notebook for the New York City Taxi Fare Prediction Playground Competition of Kaggle. Here we'll use a Gradient Boosting Regressor model which is a common winner for most Kaggle competitions to predict the fare_amount of each ride. This kernel uses some sklearn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for the critical work.

-- Aim of the project:
The goal of the competition is to accurately predict the New York city taxi prices with the least root mean square error (RMSE) on the test set.

To know more about the competition please follow the link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/overview

The training file is large and consist of 55M rows. The memory in my GitHub repository doesn't support that large a file --so please, download the training file from here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/data 

Installations required:
I am using Python 3.5.4 for this project with Jupyter notebook as Integrated Development Environment(IDE). You need to install the following libraries.mized 

- NumPy (for documentation: http://www.numpy.org/)
