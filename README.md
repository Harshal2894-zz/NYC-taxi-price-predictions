# NYC-taxi-price-predictions
This is a notebook for the New York City Taxi Fare Prediction Playground Competition of Kaggle. Here we'll use a Gradient Boosting Regressor model which is a common winner for most Kaggle competitions to predict the fare_amount of each ride. This kernel uses some sklearn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib for the critical work.
